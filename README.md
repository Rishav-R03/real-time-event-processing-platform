#  Real-Time Event Processing Platform

A robust and scalable platform that ingests, processes, stores, and monitors real-time user activity events using a distributed streaming architecture.

---

## Overview

This system simulates and processes real-time user-generated events (e.g., logins, page views, clicks) through a streaming data pipeline:

- Events are **published** to Kafka topics
- A Node.js **consumer service** processes these events:
  - **Validates** and transforms the data
  - Uses **Redis** for temporary caching or deduplication
  - Persists events to **PostgreSQL** for durability
  - Exposes **Prometheus metrics** for observability
- **Grafana dashboards** visualize metrics like stream throughput and error rates
- **CI/CD** is handled via GitHub Actions and deployed with Docker on AWS EC2

## Why This Project Matters to Businesses

### Real-World Applications
-  **User behavior analytics** for personalization and engagement
-  **System observability** for real-time application monitoring
-  **Security auditing** of user login/logout activity
-  **Business intelligence** via custom dashboards
-  **Real-time alerting** for anomaly or threshold breaches

### Business Impact
- Increases **customer intelligence** for data-driven decisions
- Improves **system reliability** through proactive monitoring
- Enhances **security** and **fraud detection**
- Powers **real-time dashboards** for operations and product teams

## Event Types & Schemas

All events share a base structure and contain a payload specific to the event type.

### Base Event Structure

```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid-v4",
  "type": "login",  // e.g., login, logout, page_view, etc.
  "timestamp": "ISO8601-UTC",
  "payload": { ... }
}
````

###  `login`

```json
{
  "eventId": "a1b2c3",
  "type": "login",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-18T14:00:00Z",
  "payload": {
    "userId": "u123",
    "ip": "203.0.113.45",
    "device": "Chrome on macOS"
  }
}
```

### `logout`

```json
{
  "type": "logout",
  "payload": {
    "userId": "u123",
    "duration": 3600,
    "ip": "203.0.113.45"
  }
}
```

### `page_view`

```json
{
  "type": "page_view",
  "payload": {
    "userId": "u456",
    "page": "/dashboard",
    "referrer": "/login",
    "device": "Firefox on Linux"
  }
}
```

### `button_click`

```json
{
  "type": "button_click",
  "payload": {
    "userId": "u456",
    "buttonId": "download-report",
    "page": "/dashboard"
  }
}
```

### `form_submit`

```json
{
  "type": "form_submit",
  "payload": {
    "userId": "u789",
    "formId": "feedback-form",
    "fields": {
      "rating": "5",
      "comment": "Great app!"
    }
  }
}
```

## Metrics to Monitor

* Event processing success/failure rate
* Stream throughput (events/sec)
* Consumer lag / queue depth
* Storage growth trends (PostgreSQL)
* Retry/duplicate metrics (via Redis)
